This is the War Room by flynn

it's a UNSW Security Society WarGame

The whole thing is on AWS-Lambda and is covered by free tier (for now)

I want to implement a few things:

The ability to archive a challenge so that there are only a limited amount available
This forces players to remain engaged but also leads to a massive repository of cool challenges

See who's solved what, how many solves, etc

Graphs!




If you want to contribute, email brainboxbrown@gmail.com

I have a box set up to run challenges on which people can connect to via net cat. eg nc IP_ADDR 3441
